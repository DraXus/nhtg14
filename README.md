About CleanBites
-----------
CleanBites allows you to either search around you or choose an address and look around in that area. We will only display places within a 1 mile radius: places you can get to easily on foot from your location.

This demo app was designed during the National Hack The Government 2014, to help citizens make an informed choice when going out to eat.

This app uses the food hygiene rating data published at www.food.gov.uk/ratings , available via an application programming interface (API) in XML and JSON formats. This is a free service and there is no need to register to use it. Terms and conditions apply (see link http://ratings.food.gov.uk/open-data/en-GB ), and guidance for developers is available.
